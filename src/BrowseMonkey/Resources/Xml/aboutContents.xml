BrowseMonkey is a simple utility for storing file structure data in Xml format. The data can be browsed without requiring direct access to the source material it was created from.

BrowseMonkey is released under the GPL, and is written entirely in C#.

For the latest version and source code, visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/browsemonkey .

If you're interested in what exactly Open Source is, http://www.opensource.org is recommended.

For a full copy of the GPL and other documentation, please check /docs under your program installation folder.

BrowseMonkey was written by Shukri Adams.

Major yahoos go out to :
* Icsharpcode for the SharpZip library, used to compressed files created in this application (http://www.icsharpcode.net).
* Phil Wright for his Magic Library, used for the docking behaviour (http://www.dotnetmagic.com - Open Source version available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dotnetmagic/).
* The Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/) - used to make the installer.

This application owes much to examples, tutorials and solutions posted online in various places, too numerous to all get a mention. I would like to single out www.codeproject.com and www.c-sharpcorner.com though.

______________________________________
0.3.0
- Optimized data displaying in   listviews somewhat. (.Net listviews   are still notoriously slow).
- Added proper click-and-open of 
  Volume files from Windows if the 
  file type is registered in Windows
  (not yet included).
- Changed the way the volume library 
  is used - you no longer have to add 
  a volume to the library when opening 
  the volume.
- Improved the search system so there 
  are more possibilities for selecting 
  which volumes to search in.
- Numerous small changes and 
  improvements.

0.2.0
Many changes :
- Totally new volume file format. 
  Previous format longer supported 
  (sorry!). New format is a single 
  file instead of previous index + 
  data file. Also added vastly 
  streamlined file accessing.
- Can now double click on any 
  Windows-registered BrowseMonkey file
  to launch BrowseMonkey and auto open
  that file.
- Can now drag any valid BrowseMonkey
  file onto BrowseMonkey to open said
  file.  
- Totally reworked the "Explorer". It
  now holds file links, and acts as
  a file library. You can use the 
  library to keep track of your 
  files. Searching is also easier when
  done one items in the library. Files
  can be dragged onto the library to 
  add them, any file opened by 
  BrowseMonkey can be automatically 
  added to the library, and files
  can be dragged around in the 
  library to organise them.
- Moved search features to seperate
  "Search" form - they had previously
  been on the "Explorer" form.
- Fixed error where volume type was 
  not saved on volume creation.
- Fixed error where copying console
  contents to memory failed.
- Fixed text dump not saving contents
  bug.  
- Fixed bug where closing a volume
  did not always free up memory used
  by that volume.
- Fixed several minor bugs and 
  glitches.
- Tweaked the layout on just about
  everything.
Removed lots of stuff :
- Can no longer produce uncompressed
  BrowseMonkey files.
- BrowseMonkey file extensions no
  longer required.
