BrowseMonkey

Requirements :
- The .Net Framework 4.0

About :
BrowseMonkey takes "snapshots" of the files and folders on your discs or network, allowing you to browse or search for files later without having direct access to them. It's main use is for quick and simple cataloging of writeable CDs and backup tapes. It will work on any filesystem or location which Windows can see. The hierarchical (tree-style) structure of files/folders is preserved, making for easy browsing in a Windows Explorer-style environment.
